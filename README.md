> Let's make some volcanoes erupt!

__NOTE:__
The created dates *must* start before the model start. Running CESM2 from year 1850 with
the first eruption in 1850 will make it crash. Setting the first eruption to 1849,
however, will make it run. The same goes for the end, the model must stop prior to the
last event, otherwise it will crash. This project will make sure one event is placed
ahead of the `init` year, but the end will vary depending on number of events created
and their frequency.

## Install

This repo is currently intended to be installed from source only. To install all
dependencies, clone the repo and install with [poetry](https://python-poetry.org):

```sh
git clone https://github.com/engeir/volcano-cooking.git
cd volcano-cooking
poetry install
# or, without development dependencies:
poetry install --no-dev
```

## Usage

There are two CLI programs coming with this project. The main program is
`volcano-cooking`, which will create a `.nc` and `.npz` file in the `data/output`
directory. With the `view_frc` program you can quickly view the content of the created
files in a plot.

Run from within this repository/directory via poetry:

```sh
poetry run volcano-cooking
poetry run view-frc <file.nc>
```

or, if the virtual environment where the project is installed is activated:

```sh
volcano-cooking
view-frc <file.nc>
```

An optional flag can be sent to the `view-frc` program that will save the plot:
`view-frc -s <file.nc>`.

In either case a `data/output` directory will be created inside the current directory
when something is saved.

For more options to either `volcano-cooking` or `view-frc`, see

```sh
volcano-cooking --help
view-frc --help
```

#### Create forcing file for CESM2

To be able to create forcing files used by the CESM2 from the newly created synthetic
file, check out the [data_source_files] directory. This holds scripts that use the
forcing file this project generates to make a new, full forcing file that CESM2 accepts
(examples of such files can be found [here][volc-frc-complete]). For example,
`createVolcEruptV3.ncl`. This need a `common.ncl` file, found [here][common-ncl], in
addition to other standard `ncl` libraries. Make sure to edit `createVolcEruptV3.ncl` to
read the created file and that the first and last year cover those used in the created
file. See the `diff` below.

Coordinate files are located [here][coord-file]. For example `fv_1.9x2.5.nc` which can be
used with two degrees resolution in the atmosphere model.

Assuming a directory tree as below and with the above-mentioned changes and downloads of
files, in addition to having run the `volcano-cooking` command, the forcing file CESM2
need can be generated by running

```sh
sh _script/create_cesm_frc.sh
```

Finally, the output file should be in `cdf5` format (check by running `ncdump -k
<file.nc>`). Converting to `cdf5` can be done with command

```sh
nccopy -k cdf5 <in-file.nc> <out-file.nc>
```

#### Compare created file with a similar used in a default CESM2 experiment

A similar file to those that are created is needed to be able to use some scripts in the
`helper_scripts` directory. By default, it assumes the file is named
`volcan-eesm_global_2015_so2-emissions-database_v1.0.nc` and that it is placed inside
the `data/originals` directory. You can find this file [here][volc-frc].

### Option 1 (directly change forcing file)

#### Get forcing and coordinate files

This option relies on having a working forcing file at hand. We will use the forcing
file that CESM2 places in the `stratvolc` directory of the `cam` model. Download from
[this link][stratvolc-forcing] and place it in the `data/originals` directory, or run
command:

```sh
wget --no-check-certificate https://svn-ccsm-inputdata.cgd.ucar.edu/trunk/inputdata/atm/cam/chem/stratvolc/VolcanEESMv3.11_SO2_850-2016_Mscale_Zreduc_2deg_c191125.nc
```

It's 2.2 GB file, so it will take some time.

We will also need a coordinate file, specifically `fv_1.9x2.5.nc` which is found
[here][coord-file]. This file is small and quick to download. From the command line:

```sh
wget --no-check-certificate https://svn-ccsm-inputdata.cgd.ucar.edu/trunk/inputdata/atm/cam/coords/fv_1.9x2.5.nc
```

#### Run library

Now the only thing we need to do is running `volcano-cooking` with the flag `-o`, and
choose the type of forcing we want (see `volcano-cooking --lst`).

## FPP

In the long run, this project should be able to produce volcanic forcing files where the
volcanic eruptions are generated from an FPP.

From the FPP we get arrival times and amplitudes. While it is obvious how the arrival
times should be input into the generation process, this is not the case with the
amplitudes.

The most natural variable to adjust according to the amplitudes is the total emission.

## Generator class

Since the volcanoes can conceivably be generated in different ways, it might be a good
idea to create a class which takes in all the variables that are needed and then checks
that all have correct properties.
